On this website you'll find electronic as well as programming projects and ideas.  
It's either stuff I'm currently researching / making or stuff I will do in the future.

I'm a C programmer so that's what I'll be programming in, but depending on the project you might find assembly or VHDL.

The microcontrollers I most often use are Microchip PIC, but I have experience with: AVR, TI, STM, ...  
Hopefully I'll get around making a few interesting posts which will use my Altera CPLD or Xilinx FPGA dev boards.

This blog is intended for people who already know electronics and programming. I'm not going to explain every little detail from the ground up.  
I do welcome everyone who wants to learn and if you don't understand something, feel free to send me an e-mail or PM.
