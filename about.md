On this website you'll find electronic as well as programming projects and ideas.
It's either stuff I'm currently building or will make in the future.

I'm a C programmer, so that's what you'll find here.

The microcontrollers I most often use are Microchip PIC, but I have experience with AVR, TI, STM, ...
Hopefully I'll get around making a few interesting posts wich will use my Altera CPLD or Xilinx FPGA dev boards.
