On this website you'll find electronic as well as programming projects and ideas.  
It's either stuff I'm currently researching / making or stuff I will do in the future.

I'm a C programmer so that's what I'll be programming in, but depending on the project you might find assembly or VHDL.

The microcontrollers I most often use are Microchip PIC, but I have experience with: AVR, TI, STM, ...  
Hopefully I'll get around making a few interesting posts which will use my Altera CPLD or Xilinx FPGA dev boards.

I'm open to any critique, suggestions or questions you might have.<br/>

I hope you'll enjoy the content.
